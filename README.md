```

### 2. Configure Ollama Cloud API (for AI Test Generation)
Create a `.env` file with your Ollama Cloud credentials:
```env
OLLAMA_HOST=https://ollama.com
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:120b-cloud
```

### 3. Run the Backend Server

Open `database_enabled_frontend.html` in your browser. The app will automatically:
- Connect to the database
- Initialize with default St. Clair requirements
- Sync all data across browsers and devices

## Usage

### Creating AI-Generated Tests
1. Navigate to the "AI Test Generator" tab
2. Click "Upload Materials" and select your study files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
3. Add custom instructions (e.g., "100 questions covering every chapter")
4. Click "Generate Practice Test" and wait 1-3 minutes
5. Save the test to your library or take it immediately

### Taking Tests
1. **Practice Mode**: Answer questions with instant feedback, save progress anytime
2. **Exam Mode**: Timed (optional), no feedback until completion, must finish in one session
3. Use color-coded navigator to track progress (purple=current, green=correct, red=incorrect, blue=answered)
4. Click "Restart" to start over with a fresh attempt

### Viewing Analytics
1. Go to "My Tests" tab
2. Click the chart icon on any test with completed attempts
3. View score trends, question-by-question performance, and statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
The app runs on port 5008. If busy, change in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5009)
```

### AI Test Generation Taking Too Long
- Large files (100+ questions) may take 2-5 minutes
- Reduce question count or file size for faster generation

### Tests Not Saving
- Ensure Flask backend is running
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify SQLite database file exists (`nursing_app.db`)

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React (via Babel), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.x)
- **Database**: SQLite with 15+ tables for comprehensive data management
- **AI Engine**: Ollama Cloud API (gpt-oss:120b-cloud model)
- **File Processing**: Supports PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD formats
- **Max Upload Size**: 200MB per request
