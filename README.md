# Nursing School Organizer

A comprehensive web application for nursing students with AI-powered test generation, study tracking, and organizational tools.

## Quick Setup Guide

### Option A: Docker Deployment (Recommended for Production)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Tailscale SSL certificates (for HTTPS access)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# Check container status
docker ps | grep nursing

# View logs
docker logs nursing-organizer

# Stop container
docker-compose down
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Gunicorn production WSGI server (2 workers, unlimited timeout)
- ‚úÖ CPU-only Whisper transcription (no GPU required)
- ‚úÖ Persistent data storage (database, audio files, model cache)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS support with Tailscale certificates
- ‚úÖ Auto-restart on failure
- ‚úÖ Health checks every 30 seconds

**Access:**
- Local: `https://localhost:5008`
- Tailscale: `https://your-machine-name.tailnet.ts.net:5008`

**Important Notes:**
- First audio transcription will download Whisper model (~141MB, takes 40-60 seconds)
- Model is cached permanently in `./whisper_cache/` - subsequent transcriptions are fast
- Audio files stored in `./audio_storage/`
- Database persists in `./data/nursing_app.db`

### Option B: Local Development Setup

### 1. Install System Dependencies
```bash
# Install FFmpeg (required for audio transcription)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg

# Or on macOS:
brew install ffmpeg

# Or on Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install Flask==2.3.3 Flask-CORS==4.0.0 python-dotenv==1.0.0 requests==2.31.0 PyPDF2==3.0.1 python-docx==1.1.0 python-pptx==1.0.2 ollama==0.3.3 pywhispercpp==1.3.3
```

### 3. Configure Ollama Cloud API (for AI Test Generation & Audio Enhancement)
Create a `.env` file with your Ollama Cloud credentials:
```env
OLLAMA_HOST=https://ollama.com
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:120b-cloud
```

### 4. Run the Backend Server
```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5008`

### 5. Open the Frontend
Open `database_enabled_frontend.html` in your browser. The app will automatically:
- Connect to the database
- Initialize with default St. Clair requirements
- Sync all data across browsers and devices

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
The app runs on port 5008. If busy, change in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5009)
```

### Audio Transcription Errors

**"FFMPEG is not installed"**:
- Install FFmpeg (see setup instructions above)
- Verify installation: `ffmpeg -version`

**Microphone not working**:
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Try using HTTPS or localhost (required for mic access)
- Test with different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

**Transcription taking too long**:
- First run downloads Whisper model (~140MB) - this is normal
- Subsequent transcriptions are much faster
- Docker deployment uses CPU-only mode (no GPU required)

**Network error / ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE on remote access**:
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Upgrade to production deployment with Docker
- Issue was caused by Flask development server not handling long-running transcriptions
- Solution: Gunicorn production server with unlimited timeout
- See `audioIssue.md` for full technical details

**Worker crashes (exit code 132)**:
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: pywhispercpp now compiled in CPU-only mode
- Previous issue: GPU-compiled binary crashed on CPU-only systems
- Solution: Force CPU-only compilation via environment variables in Dockerfile
- Docker deployment automatically uses CPU-only mode

**Audio playback not working**:
- Browser must support HTML5 audio (webm/mp3)
- Check if audio file exists in `audio_storage/` folder

For complete troubleshooting details, see [audioIssue.md](audioIssue.md)

### AI Test Generation Taking Too Long
- Large files (100+ questions) may take 2-5 minutes
- Reduce question count or file size for faster generation

### Tests Not Saving
- Ensure Flask backend is running
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify SQLite database file exists in `data/nursing_app.db`

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React (via Babel), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.x) with Gunicorn WSGI server (production)
- **Deployment**: Docker with docker-compose orchestration
- **Database**: SQLite with 15+ tables for comprehensive data management
- **AI Engine**: Ollama Cloud API (gpt-oss:120b-cloud model)
- **Speech Recognition**: Whisper.cpp (base model) - CPU-only mode for stability
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for format conversion
- **File Processing**: Supports PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD formats
- **Audio Formats**: MP3, WAV, M4A, WEBM, OGG, FLAC
- **Max Upload Size**: 200MB per request
- **Security**: HTTPS with Tailscale SSL certificates
- **Performance**: 2 sync workers, unlimited timeout for long transcriptions
