### Creating AI-Generated Tests
1. Navigate to the "AI Test Generator" tab
2. Click "Upload Materials" and select your study files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
3. Add custom instructions (e.g., "100 questions covering every chapter")
4. Click "Generate Practice Test" and wait 1-3 minutes
5. Save the test to your library or take it immediately

### Taking Tests
1. **Practice Mode**: Answer questions with instant feedback, save progress anytime

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
The app runs on port 5008. If busy, change in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5009)
```

### Audio Transcription Errors
**"FFMPEG is not installed"**:
- Install FFmpeg (see setup instructions above)
- Verify installation: `ffmpeg -version`

**Microphone not working**:
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Try using HTTPS or localhost (required for mic access)
- Test with different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

**Transcription taking too long**:
- First run downloads Whisper model (~140MB) - this is normal
- Subsequent transcriptions are much faster
- GPU acceleration speeds up processing significantly

**Audio playback not working**:
- Browser must support HTML5 audio (webm/mp3)
- Check if audio file exists in `audio_storage/` folder

### AI Test Generation Taking Too Long
- Large files (100+ questions) may take 2-5 minutes
- Reduce question count or file size for faster generation

### Tests Not Saving
- Ensure Flask backend is running
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify SQLite database file exists in `data/nursing_app.db`

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React (via Babel), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.x)
- **Database**: SQLite with 15+ tables for comprehensive data management
- **AI Engine**: Ollama Cloud API (gpt-oss:120b-cloud model)
- **Speech Recognition**: Whisper.cpp (base model) with GPU acceleration
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for format conversion
- **File Processing**: Supports PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD formats
- **Audio Formats**: MP3, WAV, M4A, WEBM, OGG, FLAC
- **Max Upload Size**: 200MB per request
